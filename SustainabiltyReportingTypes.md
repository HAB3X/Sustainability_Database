# Sustainability Frameworks & Sustainability Reporting Frameworks

### Global Goals

- global agenda by the United Nations
- 17 goals and 169 targets to achieve by 2030, to ensure developmental sustainability
- reference framework
- companies, governments, NGOs map their strategies and impacts agaisnt the goals
- used alongside reporting standards, to show how disclosed metrics contribute to global goals

### Reporting Standards

**Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)**

- focus on broad accountability to all stakeholders
- measures: Economic (indirect economic contributions, anti-corruption), Environmental (Greenhouse gas emissions, water use, waste, biodiversity), and Social impact (labour practices, human rights, diversity, community impact)
- topic-specific standards

**Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)**

- standards designed for investors to assess financially material sustainability issues
- now housed under IFRS/ISSB
- industry specific ESG metrics across 77 industries
- metrics link sustainability topics to financial performance
- investor-focused, reporting only on ESG issues that impact enterprise value in specific industries

**International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)**

- New global baseline under IFRS foundation, consolidating SASB, TCFD, and <IR>
- measures:
  - IFRS S1: General sustainability-related financial disclosures (how sustainability risks and opportunities affect enterprise value)
  - IFRS S2: climate-related disclosures (aligned with TCFD: governance, strategy, risk management, metrics, targets)
- investor-focused sustainability frameworks

**Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)**

- dislosure system used by companies, cities, investors
- driven by investor and customer requests
- measures:
  - climate change: GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2, 3), energy use, climate risks/opportunities
  - water security: water withdrawls, discharges, risks
  - forests: supply chain impacts
  - companies complete detailed questionnaires and receive a score (A-D)
- environment-focused and disclosure-driven, not general sustainability Framework

**International Organisation for Standardization (ISO)**

- set of standards and certifications for management systems, widely recognised across industries
- measured:
  - ISO 14001: Environmental management systems (EMS)
  - ISO 26000: Social responsibility guidance
  - ISO 50001: energy management
- focus on processes and systems (internal management systems)
- certification-focused

### Sustainability Theories/Models/Frameworks

**Triple Bottom Line (TBL)**

- `people, planet, profit`
- expands business performance beyond profit to include social and environmental dimensions
  - **people**: social responsibility, employee welfare, community impact
  - **planet**: environmental stewardship, emissions, resource use
  - **profit**: economic value, viability, long-term growth
- provides holistic way of evaluating organisational performance

**Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG)**

- framework for assessing a company's performance on sustainability and ethical issues relevant to investors
  - **environmental**: emissions, energy use, pollution, waste, biodiversity
  - **social**: labour rights, health & safety, diversity, community impact
  - **governance**: board structure, ethics, executive pay, shareholder rights
- common in financial markets and investor analysis
- ESG scores or ratings are provided by agencies (MSCI, Sustainalytics)
- Feeds into reporting standards like SASB & ISBB
