  "overview": "The fashion industry encompasses the design, production, marketing, and retail of clothing and accessories. It is one of the most dynamic and globally integrated industries, with a supply chain that connects raw material sourcing, textile manufacturing, garment production, and consumer distribution. Sustainability in fashion requires attention to every stage — from fibre sourcing and dyeing to packaging and post-consumer waste.",
  "factors_for_sustainability": [
    "Material sourcing and transparency — preference for organic, recycled, or certified fibres (e.g., GOTS, OEKO-TEX).",
    "Fair labour and ethical manufacturing — ensuring safe conditions, fair pay, and no forced or child labour.",
    "Water and chemical management — reducing dye runoff, wastewater, and toxic chemical use.",
    "Waste reduction and circular design — designing for durability, repairability, and recycling.",
    "Carbon and energy impact — using renewable energy and efficient transport in supply chains.",
    "Packaging and logistics — minimising plastics and using biodegradable or recycled materials."
